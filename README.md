Mini Photoshop 

This project is a simple desktop image editing application developed using Python. It provides a user-friendly interface similar to a lightweight photo editing tool, allowing users to open an image, apply different filters, adjust brightness, reset the image to its original form, and save the edited image. The application is built using Tkinter for the graphical user interface and OpenCV together with Pillow for image processing.

Project Overview

The Mini Photoshop application is designed as a beginner-friendly yet powerful project to demonstrate image manipulation in Python. It gives users the ability to experiment with different effects and transformations on images without needing professional editing software.

The program works by allowing users to load an image from their computer, then process that image using built-in functions such as grayscale conversion, blur effect, sharpening, edge detection, and brightness adjustment. The edited image can also be saved back to the system.

Features

Open Image
Users can browse their computer files and select an image to load into the application.

Reset Image
The image can be restored back to its original state at any time.

Save Image
Edited images can be saved with the desired file name and format.

Filters and Effects
The application supports several image filters including:

Grayscale filter

Blur effect

Sharpen effect

Edge detection effect

Brightness Adjustment
A slider is provided that allows users to increase or decrease the brightness of the image in real time.

Simple and Modern Interface
The layout is clean, easy to understand, and structured for smooth user interaction.

Technologies Used

Python

Tkinter for creating the graphical user interface

OpenCV for handling and processing image filters

Pillow (PIL) for displaying images within Tkinter

NumPy for handling image array operations
